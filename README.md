- 👋 Hi, I’m @lampmary
- 👀 I’m interested in process improvement, Salesforce, and learning how to code. Off the clock: brunch, soccer, coffee shops, time with friends and family, and sneakers. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code with The Odin Project (TOP). My goal is to learn fundamentals, JavaScript, and then become a Salesforce Commerce Cloud Developer. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that come along with TOP.
- 📫 How to reach me...Twitter is best. @Mary_F_Lamp
